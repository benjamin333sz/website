      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Young student dynamic and curious, I am interested on every scientist subject with a preference for computer science. I am in the third and last year of the engineering cycle at ESME Sudria with a major in Artificial Intelligence. <br>
      This website is my first website and it is still under construction (and like a piece of art, it's hard to determine when to say the work is finished...).<br>
      I absolutely not made this website from A to Z because we have new AI tools to facilitate the creation of a website. I am sorry to disappoint you. <br>
      
      There is still a lot for me to learn and discover like all of us.
      "Life is just a long learning process" after all. </p>

          <h3>My website</h3>
          <p>My personal website (Yes, this one!) hosted on GitHub Pages. You can access it <a href="https://github.com/benjamin333sz/website">here</a>)</p>

          <h3>Automatic invoice reading</h3>
          <p>My project realised in INGE 2 about automaic invoice reading with different type of AI models. I strongly recommanded to use a GPU to run some model such as the LLM Ollama model
            It was a very complete project with a lot of experiences. I put our poster in French <a href="./assets/text/poster.pdf">here</a>, our project report in French <a href="./assets/text/PROJET_COMPUTER_VISION_SZUREK_KUSNIEREK_BEHR.pdf">there</a>
            (sorry but we didn't create an english version of our rapport). The link to the GitHub project  <a href="https://github.com/benjamin333sz/Lecture_automatique_facture">here</a>

          <h3>Green Team App</h3>
          <p>An app for the association Green Team of our engineering school. The goal was that students post suggestions for improvements to reduce the footprint/energy consumption of the school. 
           We had gone very far in the project and we even realised tests directly on our own phones ! (I say "we" because I worked with Darel Zouclanounon. This is his <a href="https://github.com/daryan052205">GitHub</a> and his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darel-zoclanclounon-3363b0221/">Linkedin</a>... if I can do some add for a friend.)
